#### Dependency management in R with renv


#### R documentation with Roxygen2



#### Version Control on git with gitKraken

Dictionary:

workspace		your git account e.g. pollhammerth/ (= my home directory)
repository		a folder where your code is stored remote (online) and/or local
commit			'snapshot' in time of all the files in one of my folders (repository)
branches		different folder (repository) versions existing parallel in time
pull request		propose to merge a branch to the master (merge conflicts may occur)


Everyday coding workflow with gitkraken:

1. gitkraken: check if local repository matches remote repository and if not, pull the updates.

2. RStudio: inside the local repository, work on the code as usual

3.a when finished, check gitkraken and add a commit message (describe what you changed)

3.b stage the changed files

3.c commit the changes

3.d push the new local commit to the remote repository or

optional:

3.d' create a branch after the local commit and push it to the remote repo

4.a create pull request in gitkraken (or github) e.g. from branch_1 to main

4.b open pull request and click merge pull request

4.c pull the updated main remote repo to the local main repo

4.d under LOCAL and REMOTE click delete branch_1
